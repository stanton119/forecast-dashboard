# Research: Remove Gemini Attribution

## Summary

No research was necessary for this feature.

## Decision

The implementation will proceed by directly modifying the `src/components/Attribution.jsx` component.

## Rationale

The feature request is a simple text removal from a single, easily identifiable React component. The scope is narrow and does not involve any new technologies, architectural changes, or complex dependencies that would require investigation.
