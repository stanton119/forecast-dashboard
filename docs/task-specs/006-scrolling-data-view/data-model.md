# Data Model: Scrolling Data View

## Summary

This feature is a presentational change and does not introduce any new data models or modify existing ones.

## Existing Entities

The implementation will operate on the existing `Data Row` entity, which is passed as a prop to the relevant front-end component. The structure of `Data Row` is not affected by this change.
