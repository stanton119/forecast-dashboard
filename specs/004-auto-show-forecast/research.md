# Research Notes for Auto-show Forecast on Page Load

Based on the initial analysis and the provided feature specification, there are no immediate technical "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items arising from the "Technical Context" section of the implementation plan.

Further research might be required during implementation if unforeseen challenges arise regarding:

- Specific API integration details for weather data.
- Optimization strategies for perceived load times to meet the <1 second goal.
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms.

**Constitution Clarification**:
The current project constitution is a template. A more detailed understanding of the project's specific constitutional principles (e.g., coding standards, architectural patterns, mandatory tooling) would be beneficial for a complete "Constitution Check". This clarification is noted in the implementation plan.
